#Bad Snake Game
A really bad version of snake built using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
and was oroginaly made using [mozilla's thimble](https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org)

##if you ever want to contribute
here's a list of things I need to add if 
I ever wish to call it a proper game.
- [ ] Keep the score in a cookie
- [ ] Make the ui look acceptable
- [ ] Use JS to generate the scoreboard
- [ ] \(Optional) Refactor the code
